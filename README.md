# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, education, experience, projects, certifications, and leadership roles. Built with HTML and CSS, it’s a reflection of my journey in programming, finance, and design.

## Features

- **Interactive Hover Effects:**
  - Skill icons scale up on hover.
  - Education, experience, and leadership items lift with a shadow.
  - Project GIFs and certificate images scale slightly when hovered.
- **Clickable Images:** Project and certificate images link to live demos or verification pages.
- **Sections:**
  - **Hero:** Introduction with contact links (Email, GitHub, LinkedIn).
  - **Details:** Education, experience, skills, and leadership in a side-by-side layout.
  - **Projects & Certifications:** Grid display of projects with GIFs and certificates with images.
  - **Footer:** Centered credit to "Dibyanshu aka Luci".
- **Consistent Styling:** Gradient background, rounded elements, and a cohesive color scheme.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Structure and content.
- **CSS3:** Styling, layout (Flexbox, Grid), and animations (transitions).

## Customization
### To personalize this portfolio:

- Replace images in `images/` and `projects/` with your own (keep file names consistent or update paths).

#### Modify Styles:
- Adjust colors, sizes, or hover effects in `styles.css`.
- Example: Change the gradient in `body` or hover scale in `.project-img:hover`.

#### Add Sections:
- Duplicate a `<section>` in `index.html` and style it in `styles.css`.

#### Remove CDN:
- Download Font Awesome locally and update the `<link>` in `index.html` if offline use is needed.
